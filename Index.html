<p>My name is Henry Cook, I am a sophomore at the University of Maine studying finance. I grew up in England attending boarding school In Hertfordshire until the eighth grade. I currently live in Connecticut and went to high school in Wilton. My immediate family also live in Connecticut while my extended family live almost exclusively In England. I much prefer living in the U.S however being raised throughout Europe has definitely given me somewhat of a unique outlook on life. Iâ€™ve been incredibly fortunate when it comes to world travel having visited countries in most continents (excluding the arctic).</p>
