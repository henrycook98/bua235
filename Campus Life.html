	<p>I wanted to get the full experience of college life while at the University of Maine so I am involved in a lot of extra curriculars inlcuding Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity, Best Buddies and other Philanthropic organizations. I have been involved with my fraternity for the past two years and has really made me feel at home on campus while also pushing me to be a more responsible citizen</p>
