  <p>My family and I immigrated to the U.S in September 2011 due to the fact my dad got asked to head I.T for Lloyds bank in the North America we were only supposed to be here on a 3 year visa but we ended up getting our greencards and have now been residents for seven years with no plans to returen to England anytime soon </p>
