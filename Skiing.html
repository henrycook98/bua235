	<p>I have been skiing since I was 12 first learning in Zell am See, Austria and the Kaprun Glacier also in Austria. In highschool I competetively skied Giant Slalom and by my Junior year had become Varsity Captain. I had the opportunity to Ski for the university but declined to focus more on school.  </p>
